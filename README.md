# Skills ontology 
Skills ontology is a categorization of skills that builds a coomon language of skills, defining the aspects of a specific job raher than reyling on blanket terms and vague descriptions. To better support a skills ontology framework, more companies are realizing the value of building a skills cloud for workforce management. 
Further a skills cloud is ever evolving that means the underlying ontology is used to categorize new skills as they arise and the system is continually updated to incorporate teh latest skills any given job mat require. By using a skills cloud, companies can sift through resumes and job applications more easily and have a higher degree of confidence that shortlisted job candidates have the skills needed to fit the advertised role. A skills cloud can help a company build an internal database of the skills in its workforce and quantify the proficiency level of employees in those skills. This is beneficial on several fronts, including:

- Improving recruiting by providing a better sense of where the skills gaps exist in a workforce,
- Proactively recommend coaching and trainings so that they better meet individuals at their level of competence and build from there, and
- Creating an internal database for skills sourcing and identification so that individuals are easy to identify and call upon when needed for a project or task.

# Cluster analysis 
Cluster analysis is a class of techniques that are used to classify objects or cases into relative groups called clusters, it's is also called classification analysis or numerical taxonomy.Formulating a problem, selecting a distance measure, selecting a clustering procedure, deciding the number of clusters, interpreting the profile clusters and finally, assessing the validity of clustering. An appropriate measure of distance or similarity should be selected; the most commonly used measure is the Euclidean distance or its square.A hierarchical procedure in cluster analysis is characterized by the development of a tree like structure. A hierarchical procedure can be agglomerative or divisive.  Agglomerative methods in cluster analysis consist of linkage methods, variance methods, and centroid methods. Linkage methods in cluster analysis are comprised of single linkage, complete linkage, and average linkage.The cluster analysis is based on text mining where te mail goal is to cluster sentences where three different machine learning algorithms will be compared:
- Ngrams
- K-means learning 
- Word2vec

# Machine learning 
The machine learning Technic is based on text mining where a part artificical technology(AI) that uses natural language processing (NLP) to transform the free (unstructured) text in documents and databases into normalized, structured data suitableysis or to drive machine learning (ML) algorithms.The structured data created by text mining can be integrated into databases, data warehouses or business intelligence dashboards and used for descriptive, prescriptive or predictive analytics.


# Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
Natural Language Understanding helps machines “read” text (or another input such as speech) by simulating the human ability to understand a natural language such as English, Spanish or Chinese. Natural Language Processing includes both Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation, which simulates the human ability to create natural language text e.g. to summarize information or take part in a dialogue.As a technology, natural language processing has come of age over the past ten years, with products such as Siri, Alexa and Google's voice search employing NLP to understand and respond to user requests. Sophisticated text mining applications have also been developed in fields as diverse as medical research, risk management, customer care, insurance (fraud detection) and contextual advertising.

# Divinding the task in the team:
The task are divid among the team:
- Leyla: Ngrams and Word2vec 
- Matthijs: K-means learning 
Every friday the team discuss there codings and findings from the different algorithm. 
The aim that we have at least one cluster of sentenece by the end of April.
